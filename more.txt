I have been studying web development since 2020. In 2021, I joined an
                                intense Full Stack JavaScript bootcamp. I have been working on personal projects
                                building web applications, developing both client side (using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and
                                server side (using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL and Handlebars) codes. My previous
                                background is in Business Administration. In Brazil, I worked as human resources
                                generalist for 8 years. After moving to Chile, I worked for 1.5 years as business
                                analyst for a consulting/professional services company, performing market research on
                                Brazilian and Latin American industries.

                                In addition to hard skills such as:
                                <strong>HTML5,
                                    CSS3, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars</strong>; the dynamics
                                of the course
                                allowed me to reinforce skills acquired throughout my professional career, such as:
                                communication, teamwork, attention to detail, organization, planning and time
                                management.
